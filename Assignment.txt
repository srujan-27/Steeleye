React Component Code Review

1)Explain what the simple List component does.
Ans:  List is generally used to store data in ordered format ,here also this List is being used to render data in ordered format
list items are wrapped under WrappedSingleListItem. a handleClick function which we pass to the 
SingleListItem component by which the background color of that
particular item changes. There is also a memo method used in the
list component. React reuses the memoized content from the same
reference. By memoized, it states that it doesn't re-render
unnecessarily. The memo is used to make website speed more efficient
and perform better.

2)What problems / warnings are there with code?
Ans:
1)In our code, as the parent component, which is a wrappedListComponent,
has only one state and that is also making direct changes in our
child component, which means changing the parent will anyhow change
the child, so in such a case, using memo is a waste of memory.
2)While destructuring the array, we must follow the sequence of
occurrence of the value, and when we destructure the array of use
state in a given problem, we mismatch the sequence due to which we
named the values wrong, or say we altered the names, which caused
us to use them incorrectly, which caused us the error.
3)In the given code, the default items array was null, and it is
not possible to map over null, so we need to initialize it with some value.
4)While mapping over the array of items, we should have given the
key to each item to identify it uniquely.
5)There is a syntactical error in the predefined syntax. Instead
of using an array, we should have used arrayOf and instead of using
shapOf, we should have used the shape only.
6)While calling the call back function inside a child, we should
have used the arrow function.
7)In props check, we set the isselected value to be boolean, but
when we pass boolean values as props, the value is converted to
a string or number, so make sure to convert that to boolean before
using. 

3)Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.
Ans:
I fixed,optimized and modified the code and uploaded on github along with this pdf.
I added cursor(grab) while hovering on the items .
